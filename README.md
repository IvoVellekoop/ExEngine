ExEngine is a pure Python toolkit for building microscopy and laboratory hardware control software. Unlike application-specific software that provide tightly integrated device access, control logic, and user interfaces,ExEngine is a flexible intermediary which enables mixing and matching of components from different frameworks within a single application. This approach allows researchers to build custom software that meets their specific needs, without being limited to vertically integrated software stacks.
