# The calibration script
class CalibrationWidget:
    """Widget for calibrating pixel sizes of cameras.

    This widget demonstrates several concepts:
    * The use of the Annotated type hint to specify units and constraints for properties.
        ExEngine recognizes all public properties in the object and exposes them in the GUI.
        The Annotated type hint is used to specify units and constraints for the properties.
        These constraints are enforeced by ExEngine through the SetAttrEvent.
    * The use of the exengine.annotate.gui decorator to add a button to the GUI.
        The decorator takes the text of the button as an argument.
        The button is grayed out when the CalibrationWidget object is busy.
    * Storing device references (and lists thereof) as public attributes.
        These attributes are displayed as special fields, and allow making connections between devices.
        By specifying an interface type in the type hint, ExEngine can automatically validate
        values for these attributes.
    * Multi-device synchronization. The exengine.annotate.synchronized decorator indicates that
        during execution of this function all devices should be locked.
        Because of this decorator, the 'Calibrate' button is also grayed out when
        any of the the child devices (camera or stage) is busy.
    * Progress reporting. By requesting a '_progress' argument in any method, the engine
        will automatically provide a callback object that can be used to report progress.
        At every call to the 'update' method of this object, the progress bar in the GUI is updated.
        This also allows the user to cancel the operation, resulting in an asyncio.CancelledError exception.
    * Inter-object synchronization. In the call to 'run', the Widget *and all its child devices* are locked
        and form a synchronization group. By default, all actuators in a synchronization group (the stage)
        wait for all sensors (the cameras) to complete before starting to execute a command. Vice versa,
        all sensors wait for all actuators to complete before starting to acquire data.
    * Asynchronous programming. The 'capture' method of the camera returns a future.
        Instead of storing the frames, the futures are stored in a list. In this case, all measurements may get
        scheduled before the first one is completed.
    * on_complete callbacks. The futures that are returned by 'capture' send an 'on_complete' signal that
        we subscribe to in order to update the progress bar.
    * User interaction through a modal dialog box. The 'question' method of the engine is used to ask
        the user if the calibration results. For a text-base frontend, this will give a prompt in the console.
