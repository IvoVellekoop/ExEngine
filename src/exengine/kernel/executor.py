        Thread safety / locking:
            A device can be associated to a control thread (i.e. the `control_thread` attribute is set).
            In that case, only the control thread may submit events to the device, and an exception is raised
            if any other thread submits an event.
            Each device is initially controlled by the thread that created it. The `control_thread` can be cleared
            by calling `make_multi_threaded()`, enabling any thread to submit events to the device.
            To obtain temporary exclusive control over a device, use the `with device:` syntax.
            This will block until the ownership is released by the owning thread, and release control when the block is exited.
